<b>Academia:</b> Mark completed his first degree at the University of
Southampton in the summer of 2012 with an MEng in Aeronautics and Astronautics
with Airvehicle Systems and Design. After this, he joined the Institute for
Complex System Simulation doctoral training centre. There, he completed his PhD
entitled "Magnetic skyrmion research using virtual simulation environments",
where he investigated the behaviour of skyrmions (see image below) in
helimagnetic materials with easy-plane anisotropy, and in polycrystalline
helimagnets. To achieve this Mark created a mechanism to deploy simulation
software, which he co-wrote with other researchers, onto high-performance
computing architectures using virtual machines and containers. Mark's list of
publications is <a href="./papers.html">here</a>.

<b>Employment:</b> Mark currently works for BluPoint
Ltd. (<a href=https://www.blupoint.org>https://www.blupoint.org</a>), who aim
to create an "offline Internet" platform to disseminate educational and other
useful materials to remote communities. His work at BluPoint has allowed his
software engineering abilities to positively impact many rural communities.
