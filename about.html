<b>Current:</b> Mark currently works as a postdoctoral researcher at the
University of Southampton in the Faculty of Physical and Applied Sciences. His
primary work is on the
<a href="https://poets-project.org/">POETS project</a>, which exploits a
massively-parallel computing architecture on a fast communication
infrastructure to solve problems amenable to high-performance computing. Mark
has a blend of condensed-matter physics, engineering, mathematics, and software
development knowledge, granted to him by his singular career path. Mark's list
of publications is <a href="./papers.html">here</a>.

<b>Undergraduate and PhD:</b> Mark completed his first degree at the University
of Southampton in the summer of 2012 with an MEng in Aeronautics and
Astronautics with Airvehicle Systems and Design. After this, he joined the
Institute for Complex System Simulation doctoral training centre. There, he
completed his PhD entitled "Magnetic skyrmion research using virtual simulation
environments", where he investigated the behaviour of skyrmions (see image
below) in helimagnetic materials with easy-plane anisotropy, and in
polycrystalline helimagnets. To achieve this Mark created a mechanism to deploy
simulation software, which he co-wrote with other researchers, onto
high-performance computing architectures using virtual machines and containers.

<b>Employment:</b> While working on his PhD, Mark worked for BluPoint
Ltd. (<a href=https://www.blupoint.org>https://www.blupoint.org</a>), who aim
to create an "offline Internet" platform to disseminate educational and other
useful materials to remote communities. His work at BluPoint has allowed his
software engineering abilities to positively impact many rural
communities. Mark contined to work for BluPoint after completing his PhD for a
further year, before continuing his academic career.

Mark is also interested in general high-performance computing, videogame
design, flight simulation, microcontroller programming, and teaching. In his
free time, Mark is also a keen espresso brewer and boulderer.
