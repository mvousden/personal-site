Mark completed his first degree at the University of Southampton in the summer
of 2012 with an MEng in Aeronautics and Astronautics with Airvehicle Systems
and Design. After this, he joined the Institute for Complex System Simulation
doctoral training centre. There, he completed his PhD entitled "Magnetic
skyrmion research using virtual simulation environments", where he investigated
the behaviour of skyrmions in helimagnetic materials with easy-plane
anisotropy, and in polycrystalline helimagnets. To achieve this Mark created a
mechanism to deploy simulation software, which he co-wrote with other
researchers, onto high-performance computing architectures using virtual
machines and containers.<br/><br/>

Mark currently works for BluPoint
Ltd. (<a href=https://www.blupoint.org>https://www.blupoint.org</a>), who aim
to create an "offline Internet" platform to disseminate educational and other
useful materials to remote communities. His work at BluPoint has allowed his
software engineering abilities to positively impact many rural
communities.<br/><br/>

Mark is also interested in general high-performance computing,
videogame design, flight simulation, aircraft dynamics, and teaching.
