<h3>Why is your website so basic?</h3>


<p>So that everyone can read it, and so that I understand how to fix it if
something goes wrong. Website design inspired by
<a href=http://suckless.org/sucks/web>suckless.org/sucks/web</a>, and
<a href=http://txti.es/>txti.es/</a>.</p>

<p>Graciously hosted by
<a href=https://pages.github.com/>pages.github.com/</a>.
