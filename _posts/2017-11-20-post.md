I'm holding a talk at the University of Southampton on testing Python software
with pytest ([http://pytest.org](http://pytest.org)). After motivating the use
of testing in software development, pytest is introduced using simple
examples. I then explain some less-common, yet useful features of pytest, and
relate these features to uses in academia. For more information about the talk,
visit the Southampton Python user group page at
[https://southampton-python.github.io/](https://southampton-python.github.io/).

If you are interested in talking testing, Python or otherwise, feel free to
come along. The talk is at 1800-1930 on Wednesday 29th at the University of
Southampton, Building 6 (Nuffield Theatre), Room 1081.
