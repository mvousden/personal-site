Enabling accessible and reproducible simulation using virtual machines and
containers.

Despite their [widespread usage](http://math.nist.gov/oommf/oommf_cites.html),
micromagnetic simulation packages remain difficult to install and distribute,
especially for users with limited software experience.
This project provides pre-built [virtual machine images](https://atlas.hashicor
p.com/virtualmicromagnetics/boxes/) and [container images](https://hub.docker.c
om/u/virtualmicromagnetics/) ready to run simulations on your laptop and
high-performance compute cluster alike.
