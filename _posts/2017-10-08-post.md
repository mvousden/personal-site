title: Why is this website so basic?
---

A growing trend in the web development industry is to attach as many dynamic
objects, bells, and whistles to your frontend as possible, because apparently
the average user is more likely to stick around when you use flashy sliding
menubars. I'm not much of a web developer, but I thought I'd try something a
little different with this site by making it as minimalistic as possible, while
still trying to get across the core message, and while maintaining a little
style.

So why is this website so basic? A few reasons are:

 - So that everyone can read it, so long as they have a web browser and an
   Internet connection.

 - So that I can create and maintain it with minimal effort.

 - To prove that website creation can be simple if you're willing to open a
   terminal.

 - So that it loads as quickly as possible.

On this website, you will find no comment sections, and definitely no flashy
sliding menubars. Just text, images, and style. If you find a problem, have a
recommendation for this site, wish to leave feedback, or discuss with others,
[contact me](./contact.html) via Twitter or GitHub.

If you want to create a simple static site like this one, I recommend the use
of Jekyll with Github's page builder. To see exactly how I've done it, check
out the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/mvousden/personal-site).  The
idea of designing a website like this was inspired by [txti](http://txti.es)
and [suckless.org's post on the state of the
web](http://suckless.org/sucks/web) (strong language).
