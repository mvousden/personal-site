Traditional "big compute", powered by huge machines in data centres, suffers
from two main problems: infrastructure and maintenance costs, and scalability
(in part due to power dissipation issues). A new approach to big compute is
needed to support the exascale compute problems of tomorrow. POETS pioneers an
event-based computing approach, where many smaller, tightly-networked cores are
used over the few fast cores in traditional processors. POETS' flagship
hardware architecture is [FPGA-synthesised](https://github.com/poetsii/tinsel),
and uses [sophisticated configuration
software](https://github.com/poetsii/Orchestrator) to map applications onto the
hardware, and manage their execution.
